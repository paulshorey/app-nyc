# ALL EVENTS [in] NYC

Hello! This is my sandbox environment, to mess around with new technologies.

allevents.nyc = thousands of events, organized by categories, filtered by time and keyword ... login with facebook to save your searches, save individual events to cookies and social calendars, coming soon
app.allevents.nyc = my sever, development environment, probably won't work most of the time, but will be running the latest build

This app originated from Stamplay's https://github.com/Stamplay/stamplay-ionic-starter-with-social-login example. I used it for the social login component and their backend SAAS SDK. That is now the only similarity. Many more APIs added.

Most recently, added ReactJS, and better Gulp automation.
